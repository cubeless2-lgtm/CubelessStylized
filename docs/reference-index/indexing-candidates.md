# External Project Indexing Candidates

This document tracks external Unreal projects that can be indexed for CubelessStylized MCP, BP, AnimBP, PCG, UI, and gameplay workflow expansion. Source projects stay outside this repository.

## Current Local Candidates

| Priority | Project | Root | Main Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Game Animation Sample | `D:/Git/GameAnimationSample` | AnimBP, Motion Matching, Chooser, Pose Search, traversal | Index now for modern animation systems. |
| 2 | Lyra Starter Game | `D:/Git/LyraStarterGame` | Linked Anim Layers, weapon animation, GAS, input, CommonUI | Index now for Unreal architecture and animation layers. |
| 3 | Electric Dreams Env | `D:/Git/ElectricDreamsEnv` | PCG graphs, custom PCG nodes, breakdown maps | Index now for PCG specialization. |
| 4 | Basic Multiplayer Melee Combat | `D:/Git/BasicMultiplayerMeleeComb` | Melee BP, montage combos, combat components | Index now for combat and montage workflow. |
| 5 | Stack O Bot MCP copy | `D:/Git/SampleProject/StackOBot_MCP` | Lightweight BP, PCG, UI, character animation | Index now if the copy is the intended MCP-safe sample. |
| 6 | Cropout Sample Project | `D:/Git/CropoutSampleProject` | BP gameplay loop, mobile-oriented UI, villager/game systems | Index after the first AnimBP/PCG pass. |
| 7 | ACOM Animation Sample | `D:/Git/ACOMAnimationSample` | AnimBP and Control Rig | Index for animation/control-rig specialization. |
| Deferred | Ancient Middle East Market | `D:/Git/AncientMiddleEastMarketE` | Environment, prefabs, material/POM reference | Defer; not core for AnimBP/BP/PCG automation. |
| Deferred | SampleProject root | `D:/Git/SampleProject` | Wrapper folder | Defer root; index `StackOBot_MCP` inside it instead. |

## AnimBP Indexing

### Game Animation Sample

Grade: `A` for Motion Matching, Chooser, Pose Search, Mover, traversal references.

First assets:

- `/Game/Blueprints/SandboxCharacter_Mover_ABP`
- `/Game/Blueprints/SandboxCharacter_CMC_ABP`
- `/Game/Characters/UEFN_Mannequin/Animations/MotionMatchingData/CHT_PoseSearchDatabases_Mover`
- `/Game/Characters/UEFN_Mannequin/Animations/MotionMatchingData/Schemas/PSS_Default_Mover`
- `/Game/Characters/UEFN_Mannequin/Animations/MotionMatchingData/Databases/PSD_Traversal`
- `/Game/Characters/UEFN_Mannequin/Animations/Traversal/CHT_TraversalMontages_Mover`

Notes:

- Good modern animation reference.
- No `Source` folder was visible, so C++ source-level analysis is limited.
- AnimGraph node details, PoseSearch schema details, and compile results require editor/MCP indexing.

### Lyra Starter Game

Grade: `A` for Linked Anim Layers, weapon-specific animation layers, GAS/input/UI architecture.

First assets:

- `/Game/Characters/Heroes/Mannequin/Animations/ABP_Mannequin_Base`
- `/Game/Characters/Heroes/Mannequin/Animations/LinkedLayers/ALI_ItemAnimLayers`
- `/Game/Characters/Heroes/Mannequin/Animations/LinkedLayers/ABP_ItemAnimLayersBase`
- `/Game/Characters/Heroes/Mannequin/Animations/Locomotion/Rifle/ABP_RifleAnimLayers`

Notes:

- Has `Source`, `Plugins/GameFeatures`, and `Content`, so it is a good deep-analysis source.
- Use as architecture/reference material, not as a direct pattern to copy wholesale.

### ACOM Animation Sample

Grade: `A/B` for AnimBP and Control Rig specialization.

First assets:

- `Content/AnimationSample/Assets/characters/ch_beta_ue/Rigs/Beta_ABP.uasset`
- `Content/AnimationSample/Assets/characters/ch_beta_ue/Rigs/Beta_CtrlRig.uasset`
- `Content/AnimationSample/Assets/characters/ch_beta_ue/Rigs/Beta_CR_Corrective.uasset`
- `Content/AnimationSample/Assets/characters/ch_omega_ue/Rigs/Omega_ABP.uasset`

Notes:

- Use after the first AnimBP read-only inventory exists.
- Better for animation/control-rig specialization than general BP/gameplay indexing.

## PCG Indexing

### Electric Dreams Env

Grade: `A` for PCG graph and custom node references.

First folders/assets:

- `/Game/PCG/Graphs`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/PCGCustomNodes`
- `/Game/Levels/PCG/Breakdown_Levels`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/PCGAssemblies/LargeAssembly`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/PCGAssemblies/Ditch`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/PCGAssemblies/Forest`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/PCGAssemblies/Ground`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/BP_PCG_LargeAssembly`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/BP_PCG_SmallAssembly`
- `/Game/PCG/Assets/BP_PCG_LocationMarker`
- `/Game/PCG/Utilities`
- `/Game/Levels/PCG/ElectricDreams_PCGCloseRange`

Notes:

- `ElectricDreams_PCGCloseRange` is the first smoke-test map.
- Full `ElectricDreams_PCG` is useful but heavy; index it after breakdown maps.
- Exact PCG node pins, graph settings, generation results, and actor enumeration require editor/MCP indexing.

### Stack O Bot MCP Copy

Grade: `A/B` for lightweight BP, PCG, UI, and character examples.

First assets:

- `/Game/StackOBot/Blueprints/PCG/PCG_FenceSpline`
- `/Game/StackOBot/Blueprints/PCG/PCG_GridSpawn`
- `/Game/StackOBot/Blueprints/PCG/PCG_RingSpawn`
- `/Game/StackOBot/Blueprints/Character/BP_Bot`
- `/Game/StackOBot/UI/Game/UI_Game`
- `/Game/StackOBot/UI/MainMenu/UI_MainMenu`
- `/Game/StackOBot/Characters/Bot/ABP_Bot`

Notes:

- Use `D:/Git/SampleProject/StackOBot_MCP`, not the ambiguous `D:/Git/SampleProject` root.
- Good small sample before large Electric Dreams workflows.

## Gameplay BP and Combat Indexing

### Basic Multiplayer Melee Combat

Grade: `A` for melee BP, combat montage sequence, weapon data, and multiplayer combat structure.

First assets:

- `Content/BMMCSystem/Blueprints/Components/BPC_CombatStateManager.uasset`
- `Content/BMMCSystem/Blueprints/Components/BPC_BasicMontageSequenceManager.uasset`
- `Content/BMMCSystem/Blueprints/DataTables/DT_Combos.uasset`
- `Content/BMMCSystem/Blueprints/DataTables/DT_Weapons.uasset`
- `Content/BMMCSystem/Animations/Combat/Montages/AM_RightSwing.uasset`
- `Content/BMMCSystem/Maps/Multiplayer/MultiplayerArena.umap`

Notes:

- Best current local sample for melee/combo/montage BP indexing.
- PCG value is low.

### Cropout Sample Project

Grade: `B` for BP gameplay loop, mobile-friendly systems, and UI.

First assets:

- `Content/Blueprint/Core/GameMode/BP_GM.uasset`
- `Content/Blueprint/Core/Player/BP_Player.uasset`
- `Content/Blueprint/Villagers/BP_Villager.uasset`
- `Content/UI/Game/UI_GameMain.uasset`
- `Content/UI/Common/CUI_Button.uasset`
- `Plugins/IslandGenerator/Content/BP_IslandGen.uasset`

Notes:

- Good for BP game loop and UI patterns.
- Treat IslandGenerator as procedural BP reference, not native PCG reference.

## Next Steps

1. Create read-only JSON indexes for the `A` sources first.
2. Add editor/MCP deep indexing only on project copies, not pristine source projects.
3. Keep generated JSON and notes in `docs/reference-index/<project>/`.
4. Promote only reviewed `A` patterns into MCP generation rules.
5. Keep `B/C/Blocked` patterns searchable but unavailable for automatic generation without Ieta review.
